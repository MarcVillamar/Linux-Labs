### Objective

In this lab, I will work with the Linux shell to investigate, create, remove, and make my way throught the Linux architecture for file management.

### Skills Learned

- Linux navigation and file management for large organizations.
- Identify and modify Linux permissions based on the role of any given user.
- Navigate throught multiple directories to get to the correct one and assign correct perimissions.
- Work with hidden files and gather thoughts on solution for common problems and engage in linux administration.
- Engage in not only file permissions, but also directory permissions.

### Tools Used

- Linux command line interface for file/directory permissions.

- First evaluate the given scenario of how to proceed with the Linux lab.
  [Scenario](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13eWAn655pE6id3dF4i3ij58YMawkk85Q8DTD5D48sUY/edit#heading=h.1ql9278wlm6l)
- Second is to evaluate current permissions on the Linux system.
